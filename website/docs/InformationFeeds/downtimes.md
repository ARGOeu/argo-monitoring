title: Downtimes   
---

The term downtime is used to refer to periods when a service is unavailable. Downtime can be caused by failure in hardware (physical equipment), (logic controlling equipment), interconnecting equipment (such as cables, facilities, routers,...), transmission (wireless, microwave, satellite), and/or capacity (system limits).
Apart from a downtime due to an unplanned event there is also downtime as a planned event due to a routing maintenance. 

Scheduling downtime is an effective way to prevent unnecessary or unwanted notifications from being received during a period of expected service interruption.

ARGO Monitoring Service takes into consideration the scheduled downtime to calculate the Reliability of a service or a group of services. At the same time the service doesnt send  unnecessary notifications during
periods of expected service interruption.
