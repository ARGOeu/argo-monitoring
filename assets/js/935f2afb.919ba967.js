It needs to be continuous and on-demand to quickly detect, correlate, and analyse data for a fast reaction to anomalous behaviour. The challenge of this type of monitoring is how to quickly identify and correlate problems before they affect end-users and ultimately the productivity of the organisation. Management teams can monitor the availability and reliability of the services from a high level view down to individual system metrics and monitor the conformance of multiple SLAs.  The key functional requirements are:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"InformationFeeds/downtimes":{"id":"InformationFeeds/downtimes","title":"Downtimes","description":"The term downtime is used to refer to periods when a service is unavailable.
